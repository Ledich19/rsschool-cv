## About Myself:
Hello, I want to become a full stack developer. Even when entering the university, I wanted to get an IT specialty, but did not pass for free education. Then, when I realized that I didn't like my current job, I started looking for other options. I remembered my school hobby. And there were opportunities to become a programmer without a university.I decided that yes, this is what I want. Thus began my self-education. I started by solving problems from the Euler project. And gradually I already found useful resources and information for further learning.


Now I can write an application in React and Node and even tried to look for a job. concluded. What else do you need to learn English to put the project on github and it is desirable to gain experience in the team, that's why I'm here :)


I enjoy learning and finding creative solutions to problems. For example, in my thesis work there were a lot of calculations. And I made an ixel file that completely did it all for me. It was enough for me to enter the input data. Therefore, I made a diploma in the fifth year already very quickly :)
